# Section II: Mentor / Mentee Guide

## Introduction

The mission of the Mentorship Initiative (MI) is to help other Initiatives within Node.js acquire Mentees and assist in transitioning them into long-term Members of those Initiatives. We are actively developing a process to facilitate that mission in a streamlined fashion. This section of the Onboarding Guide is meant to provide you, the Mentor, with the necessary knowledge to participate effectively and easily in that process.

**Note**: Please refer to the Glossary at the end of the Onboarding Guide if you see terms or abbreviations you’re not familiar with in this section.

## Process Overview

Our process consists of four main phases from a Mentor’s point of view.

## Mentor:

### Phase 1: Planning

In the planning phase, the MI and Mentor work together to determine and specify the needs of the Initiative. This can include designing a test or code challenge to filter Applicants with and always ends with a Initiative Application.

### Phase 2: Acquisition

During most of the acquisition phase, the Mentor is just waiting to give people time to hear about and complete the Initiative Application. Near the end of this phase, the Mentor has the opportunity to review or be involved in the selection of the Mentee.

### Phase 3: Onboarding
Once the Mentee has been selected, our aim is to transition that person smoothly onto the Initiative and ensure a good fit. The MI will gather feedback, give recommendations, and potentially provide an alternative Mentee in the event the first isn’t working out.

### Kickoff Meeting
As well as below, details about the Kickoff Meeting can be found [here](../kickoff_meetings.md).

**Note**: It is not recommended to add the Mentee to the specific channel you will be communicating with us on. 

1. Schedule the meeting
  * Reach out to Mentee for introductions and set quarterly 3 month goal
    * Detail milestones along the way
  * Set 1st win
  * Set time for weekly check in

2. Weekly Check-in
  * Monitor progress towards goal
  * Answer questions
  * Ask how previous or ongoing task is going
  * Answer any questions  
  * Set new tasks for things to work on

### Phase 4: Acceptance

Once the Initiative is satisfied with the selected Mentee and the Mentee is accepted as a Member of the Initiative, communication between the MI and the Initiative ends until another Mentee is needed.

## Mentee:

### What does it mean to be a Mentee? 

As a mentee you will attend meetings with your Mentor and take on tasks related to the goals of the initiative you are in. This means getting up close and personal with some integral workings of one of the largest community based programming ecosystems in the world. 

In general, the Mentorship Initiative wants to bring passionate and talented people into the Node.js community.

During your time as a Mentee you will get to know many amazing members of the community as well as an in depth grasp of the Node.js ecosystem. After the mentee period ends — and depending on the amount of effort put into the mentee position — you will be in a great position to do more in the Node.js community.

## Mentee Expectations

In addition to the decisions made in your [Kickoff Meeting](../kickoff_meetings.md), you will expected to create opportunities for yourself and create your own goals with the guidance of your Mentor.

Note that each Mentee position is different when it comes to time needed to invest. This will be described in the Mentee description when the position has been opened.

However, at least 1 hour per week is needed to account for a weekly meeting with your Mentor. More hours will likely be needed to set aside time for work pertaining to your mentorship throughout the week -- depending on the needs of the Initiative you are assigned to.

### Responsibilities

1. Assist the Initiative you are assigned to the best of your abilities.

2. Stay on target with the goals you and your Mentor have set as well as stay up to date on tasks suggested to you by Mentor.

3. Be on time to your scheduled meetings between your Mentor and yourself.
